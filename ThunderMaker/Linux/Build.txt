Build environment

1. Dependencies
Compiling wxWidgets 2.9 requires the following dependencies. You should install them using the packager of your Linux distribution.
- g++ GNU c++ compiler
- GTK2 and development packages: libgtk2.0-dev
- OpenGL and GLU development headers (Mesa OpenGL development packages)
  freeglut3, freeglut3-dev, mesa-common-dev
- X11 video mode extension library: libxxf86vm-dev
Compiling and linking TrenchBroom requires a working OpenGL installation. This page may help you if you see linker errors about missing GL libraries:

2. wxWidgets
- Get the latest sources of wxWidgets 2.9 from wxwidgets.org and unpack them.
- Move the unpacked directory someplace where you want to keep it.
- Open a terminal and change into the wxwidgets directory.
- Create two directories: build-release and build-debug (don't rename those!)
- Change into wxwidgets/build-release
- Run 
  ../configure --disable-shared --with-opengl
- Run make (don't run make install!)
- Change into wxwidgets/build-debug
- Run 
  ../configure --enable-debug --disable-shared --with-opengl
- Run make (don't run make install!)

3. Code::Blocks
- Get the latest version of the Code::Blocks IDE using the package manager.
- Create a global variable named "WXWIN" in Code::Blocks.
  - Click Menu > Settings > Global Variables...
  - Click on the second "New" button (in the "Current Variable" row).
  - Enter "WXWIN" (without quotes) as the name for the new variable.
  - In the "Builtin fields" column, click the ".." button next to the first text field (labeled "base").
  - In the Open file dialog, select the directory where you extracted the wxWidgets sources. 
- Optional: Go to Settings -> Compiler and Debugger... search for the Other settings tab: Set the number of processes for parallel builds to the number you'd like to use.
