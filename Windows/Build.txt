Build environment
1. You need Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. The Express edition won't work. Sorry.

2. wxWidgets
- Get the binary build of wxWidgets 2.9.4 for your platform from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.4/binaries/

  - For 32bit builds, you need the following files:
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_Headers.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4-vc100_Dev.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_vc100_ReleaseDLL.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_vc100_ReleasePDB.7z
  - For (experimental) 64bit builds, you need the following files:
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_Headers.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4-vc100_x64_Dev.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_vc100_x64_ReleaseDLL.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_vc100_x64_ReleasePDB.7z

- Unpack all files into the same directory so that "include" and "lib" directories are at the same level after unpacking.
- Finally, set up an environment variable named "WXWIN" pointing to the directory that contains the aforementioned directories.

3. Build
Open the Visual Studio solution at Windows/TrenchBroom.sln and compile / run it!
